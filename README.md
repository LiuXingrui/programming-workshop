# A programming workshop 

Learn how to run jobs on HPCC and related tools to boost programming
efficiency, including git/github, emacs, tmux, Makefile,
oh-my-zsh. There are also some optional topics like VS Code, Docker, auctex.



## Content
- HPCC
  - HPCC is the cluster computer at UCR. Before the workshop, try to
    finish the following two steps to make sure you can access it
    through `ssh` and run basic linux command
  - [obtain an account](https://hpcc.ucr.edu/rates.html)
  - [get started](https://hpcc.ucr.edu/manuals_linux-cluster_start.html)
  - a tip: [ssh without pasword](http://www.linuxproblem.org/art_9.html)
  - Everything else in this workshop shall work in any unix-like
    environment. But usually we rely on the computing power of HPCC to
    do heavy calculations.
- Editor and Window management
  - [emacs](https://ccrma.stanford.edu/guides/package/emacs/emacs.html)
  - [tmux](https://tmuxcheatsheet.com/)
  - VS Code and rmate (not to be covered here)
- Makefile
  - Makefile is a shortcut for all kinds of commands. It appears everywhere.
  - [introduction](https://www.cs.colby.edu/maxwell/courses/tutorials/maketutor/)
- Git/GitHub
  - `git` is a version control software, and github is one of the online hosts.
  - [Git](https://itnext.io/become-a-git-pro-in-just-one-blog-a-thorough-guide-to-git-architecture-and-command-line-interface-93fbe9bdb395)
  - [GitHub](https://github.com/QEC-pages) We will create several repos in the QEC-pages to demonstrate how to collaborate through branches and pull requests.
- oh-my-zsh
  - [homepage](https://ohmyz.sh/)
  - `oh-my-zsh` is a version of `zsh`, an ultimate alternative to `bash`. It is very helpful when working in a git repo.
  - we will also make use of `~/.bashrc` and similar files here.
- C++
  - [Quick compilation with multiple files](https://www.cs.fsu.edu/~myers/c++/notes/compilation.html)
  - comment style with [Doxygen](https://www.doxygen.nl/index.html)
